        <h1>How to Play:</h1>
        <p>Cards that are face up and showing may be moved from the stock pile or the columns to the
            foundation stacks or to other columns.</p>
        <p>To move a card to a column, it must be one less in rank and the opposite color. For example, if it
            was a 9 of hearts (red), you could put an 8 of spades or clubs onto it. Stacks of cards may be
            moved from one column to another as long as they maintain the same order (highest to
            lowest, alternating colors).</p>
        <p>If you get an empty column, you can start a new column with a King. Any new column must be
            started with a King (or a stack of cards that starts with a King).</p>
        <p>To get new cards from the stock pile, you turn three cards at a time face up into the stack next
            to the stock pile called the waist stack. You can only play the top card off the waist stack. If you
            run out of stock cards, turn the waist stack over to make a new stock pile and start again, pulling
            the top three cards off, turning them over, and starting a new waist stack.</p>
